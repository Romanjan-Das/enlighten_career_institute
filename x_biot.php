                <li>Enlighten Career Institute offers Classes for IIT-JAM in Biotechnology. Our Faculty covers full
                    syllabus based on in-depth analysis of previous years JAM Question Papers and starts from very basic
                    level to advanced level .</li>
                <li>JAM Biotechnology Coaching will also help you for other M.Sc Entrance Exams ; such as Tezpur
                    university entrance exam , Guwahati university entrance exam , NEHU Entrance exam and other state
                    level university Entrance exams as well as other central level exams like TIFR, DU, CMI , NBHM, BHU
                    and CUCET.</li>
                <li>Topic wise Quality study material with Practice Questions are provided .</li>
                <li>Daily Practice Problems are provided after every class based on the topic which was covered in class
                    , that should be submitted by students in next class for making himself/herself eligible for refund
                    if selected in JAM (Condition applied)</li>
                <li>The assessment of performance is done on regular basis through Weekly Test based on actual JAM exam
                    pattern which are followed by discussions. </li>
