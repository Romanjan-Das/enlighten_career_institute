                The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are institutions of national importance established through
                an Act of Parliament in 1956. The Indian Institute of Science (IISc) is a premier research and teaching
                institute established in 1909. The IISc Bangalore and IITs are well-known, the world over, for quality
                education in engineering, science, management and research in frontier areas.
                <br><br> The aim of these
                institutes is to build a sound foundation of knowledge, pursue excellence and enhance creativity in an
                intellectually stimulating environment. The current pace of advancement of technology needs a coherent
                back-up of basic science education and research. The vibrant academic ambience and research
                infrastructure at IISc Bangalore and IITs motivate students to pursue Research and Development careers
                in frontier areas of basic sciences as well as interdisciplinary areas of science and technology.
                Further, IISc and IITs have well-equipped modern laboratories, efficient computer networks and
                state-of-the-art libraries.
                <br><br>
                The teaching process is structured to promote close and continuous interface
                between the faculty and the students. A number of financial assistantships are available to SC/ST and
                other deserving and meritorious students at individual institutes. From the Academic Session 2004-05,
                IITs started conducting a Joint Admission Test for Masters (JAM). The objective of JAM is to provide
                admissions to M.Sc. (Two Years), Joint M.Sc.-Ph.D., M.Sc.-Ph.D. DualDegree, and other Post- Bachelor
                Degree Programmes at the IITs and Integrated Ph.D. Degree Programmes at the IISc and to consolidate
                Science as a career option for bright students across the country. JAM has been established as a
                benchmark for the undergraduate level science education in the country. The Integrated Ph.D. Programme
                at IISc, started in the early 1990s to enable students to directly join a Ph.D. Programme after their
                B.Sc. Degree, has flourished under JAM.
                <br><br>
                The M.Sc. (Two Years), Joint M.Sc.-Ph.D., M.Sc.-Ph.D. Dual Degree, and other Post-Bachelor’s Degree
                Programmes at the IITs and the Integrated Ph.D. Programmes at the IISc offer quality education in their
                respective disciplines, comparable to the best in the world. The curricula for these programmes
                are designed to provide the students with opportunities to develop academic talent leading to
                challenging and rewarding professional life.
                <br><br>
                The curriculums are regularly updated at the IISc and IITs. The interdisciplinary content of the
                curricula equips the
                students with the ability to utilize scientific knowledge for practical applications. The medium of
                instruction is English for all the above-mentioned programs. All programs are open to all eligible
                students irrespective of their nationality.

                The JAM 2021 Examination for all the seven test papers will be carried out as ONLINE Computer Based Test
                (CBT) where the candidates will be shown the questions in a random sequence on a computer screen. For
                all the seven test papers, the duration of the examination will be of 3 hours. The medium for all the
                test papers will be English only. There will be a total of 60 questions carrying a total of 100 marks.
                The entire paper will be divided into three sections, A, B and C. All sections are compulsory. Questions
                in each section will be of different types as given below:
                <br><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Section–A contains a total of 30 Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) involving 10 questions of one
                        mark each and 20 questions of two marks each. Each MCQ has four choices out of which only one
                        choice is the correct answer. Candidates can mark the answer by clicking the choice.

                    </li>
                    <li>Section–B contains a total of 10 Multiple Select Questions (MSQ) carrying two marks each. Each
                        MSQ is similar to MCQ but with the difference that MSQ may have one or more than one correct
                        choice(s) out of the four given choices. The candidate gets full credit only if he/she selects
                        all the correct answer(s) only and no wrong answers. Candidates can mark the answer(s) by
                        clicking the choice(s).

                    </li>
                    <li>Section–C contains a total of 20 Numerical Answer Type (NAT) questions involving 10 questions of
                        one mark each and 10 questions of two marks each. For these NAT type questions, the answer is a
                        signed real number, which needs to be entered using the virtual numeric keypad on the monitor.
                        No choices will be shown for NAT questions.

                    </li>
                    <li>In all sections, questions not attempted will result in zero marks. In Section-A (MCQ), wrong
                        answer will result in negative marks. For each wrong answer to 1 mark questions, 1/3 mark will
                        be deducted, and similarly, for each wrong answer to 2 marks questions, 2/3 mark will be
                        deducted. In Section-B (MSQ), there are no negative and no partial marking provisions. There is
                        no negative marking in Section-C (NAT) as well.

                    </li>
                    <li>There is a provision for using an online virtual calculator. The candidates, therefore, should
                        not bring any calculator with them.

                    </li>
                    <li>Mobile phones and any other electronic devices are strictly prohibited inside the examination
                        hall. Charts, graph sheets, and tables are also NOT allowed inside the examination hall.

                    </li>
                    <li>A scribble pad will be provided for rough work. The candidate has to write his/her name and
                        registration number before using it. The candidate can possess only one scribble pad at any
                        point of time. A second scribble pad is given only upon returning the first one. The scribble
                        pad has to be returned at the end of the examination.

                    </li>
                    <li>The candidates are required to select the answer for MCQ and MSQ type questions using the mouse.
                        The answer for NAT questions can be entered using a virtual numeric keypad (the keyboard of the
                        computer will be disabled).

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At the end of 3 hours, the computer will automatically end the examination. The candidates have
                        to be careful and submit their answers before the end of the examination.
                    </li>
                </ul>
