            The idea to start ENLIGHTEN CAREER INSTITUTE evolved from the fact that there is no such institute in entire
            North Eastern region that can nurture the B.Sc. students to enter the top institutes of the country for
            pursuing their higher studies. Also due to lack of proper guidance or strategy after class 12th , many
            Engineering and Medical aspirants cannot enter into the topmost engineering and medical colleges
            respectively. Hence, ECI will light the path for such students who opted B.Sc. as a compulsion after their
            12th to embrace their own interest.
