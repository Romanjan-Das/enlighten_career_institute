                    <li>Enlighten Career Institute offers Classes for IIT-JAM in Statistics. Our Faculty covers full
                        syllabus based on in-depth analysis of previous years JAM Question Papers and starts from very
                        basic level to advanced level
                    <li>Topic wise Quality study material with Practice Questions are provided .</li>
                    <li>Daily Practice Problems are provided after every class based on the topic which was covered in
                        class , that should be submitted by students in next class for making himself/herself eligible
                        for refund if selected in JAM (Condition applied)</li>
                    <li>The assessment of performance is done on regular basis through Weekly Test based on actual JAM
                        exam pattern which are followed by discussions. </li>
                    <li>By Qualifying JAM Students can get Admission in M.sc. Computer Science</li>
